Want to make your Minecraft Java server playable by Bedrock players? It's super easy! Follow this GeyserMC setup guide, guaranteed to be simple and easy to follow. üöÄ

## What is GeyserMC?

**GeyserMC** is a proxy that allows Minecraft Bedrock Edition players (on mobile, console, or Windows 10) to play on Minecraft Java Edition servers. Perfect for those who want to reach more players.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** GeyserMC does not convert Minecraft Bedrock into Minecraft Java. GeyserMC only works as a bridge for connection.

## Preparation Before Starting

1. **Spigot or Its Fork Server**: Make sure your server is using [Spigot](https://getbukkit.org/), [Paper](https://papermc.io/), or [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/download/purpur/).

2. **GeyserMC Plugin**: Download the .jar file from the official [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) site. This step can be skipped if you use our "Plugin Installer".

3. **Floodgate Plugin (Optional)**: If you want Bedrock players to join without a Microsoft account, download [Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/floodgate).

## Steps to Set Up GeyserMC

Let's get started! üíª

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download GeyserMC & Floodgate Plugins üì•">
    1. Visit the [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) site and download the GeyserMC plugin file, or you can use our "Plugin Installer" :D.

    2. If needed, also download the Floodgate plugin from the "Plugin Installer" section.

    Make sure you download the version that matches your server.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Allocation for Bedrock Port ‚öôÔ∏è">
    1. Log in to your server panel.

    2. Go to the **Network** or **Allocations** section.

    3. Create a new allocation for the Bedrock port.

    4. Make sure this new port is different from the Java port.

    If not possible, you can use the same port as the Java port but set the bind address in the configuration file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Plugins to Server üì§">
    1. Open the **File Manager** in your server panel.

    2. Go to the **plugins** folder.

    3. Upload the GeyserMC and Floodgate .jar files into that folder.

    This step can be skipped if you use our "Plugin Installer".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Server üîÑ">
    After the files are uploaded, restart your server. The GeyserMC and Floodgate plugins will automatically create configuration files.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure GeyserMC ‚öôÔ∏è">
    1. Open the **plugins/Geyser-Spigot** folder.

    2. Edit the **config.yml** file using a text editor.

    Things to configure:

    * **bedrock.address**: Leave it as `0.0.0.0` to accept connections from all IPs.

    * **bedrock.port**: Fill in with the port you created in the previous step (default: `19132`).

    * **remote.address**: Leave it as `127.0.0.1` if GeyserMC and the Java server are on the same machine.

    * **remote.port**: Fill in with the Java server port (default: `25565`).

    Example configuration:

    ```yaml
    bedrock:
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 19132

    remote:
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port: 25565
    ```

    Don't forget to save the changes!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Finish! üéÆ">
    1. Restart your server again.

    2. Bedrock players can connect with the **server IP address** and the Bedrock port you set earlier.

    3. Check the server log to ensure there are no errors.

    If everything is fine, your server now supports both Bedrock and Java players. Good luck! üòä
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Tips

1. **Floodgate**: If you use the Floodgate plugin, MCBE players can join directly without logging into a Microsoft account. Just enable the "auth-type: floodgate" option in the GeyserMC **config.yml** file.
   ```yaml
   remote:
   auth-type: floodgate
   ```

2. **Server Performance**: GeyserMC requires more resources than a regular Java server. Make sure your server has sufficient specifications.

3. **Support**: If you encounter issues, check the [official GeyserMC documentation](https://wiki.geysermc.org/) or ask in their community.

Super easy, right? If you're still confused, don't hesitate to ask in the Minecraft community or contact the **ZeroCloud** support team. Good luck and happy exploring! üöÄ
