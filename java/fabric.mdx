Want to explore Minecraft with cool mods? Here's an easy guide to installing mods using **Fabric** on your Minecraft server.

## Before You Start, Make Sure You're Prepared

3. Prepare the mods you want to use from trusted sources like **[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** Servers with Fabric **do not support Bukkit or Spigot plugins**. If you want a hybrid server, you can use additional mods like **Mohist** (with stability risks).
