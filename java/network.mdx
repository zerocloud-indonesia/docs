Ever experienced a delay while enjoying Minecraft? 😤 High ping can be a big problem. Ping is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from your device (client) to the Minecraft server and back again. If your ping is below **200ms**, that's normal, depending on how far your server is. But if your ping is over **500ms**, it means something is wrong, and we need to find out why. 👀

## 🔍 Finding the Cause of High Ping
The first step to fixing high ping is to find out the cause. One easy way is to open **Command Prompt** (or terminal) and type `ping {IP}` (without the port). You can find the server IP on the "Console" page in the ZeroCloud panel, just copy and paste it. If the ping is very high, it means there is a problem between you and the server. But if the ping is normal in Command Prompt but still high in the game, it means the problem is with your game server. 🖥️

### ⚠️ Common Causes of High Ping:
#### 1. **Snapshot Version:**
   - Don't use unstable snapshot versions. Snapshots are like beta versions, often full of bugs and performance issues. If you are using a snapshot version, try updating to a **stable** version, which is more tested and faster. Sometimes ping issues are due to bugs in the version being tested. 🐞

#### 2. **Network Compression Threshold:**
   - In the `server.properties` file, there is a setting called **Network Compression Threshold**. This controls how much data can be sent without being compressed first. The default setting is usually **256**, so if you're not sure, leave it at that. If the setting is too low or too high, it can cause ping issues. ⚙️

#### 3. **Service Disruptions:**
   - High ping can also be due to issues on our server. Check our **service status** at [ZeroCloud status link](https://status.zerocloud.id) to see if there are any disruptions on the server. If there are issues on our server, you usually just need to wait for the fix. 🛠️

#### 4. **KeepAliveTimeout:**
   - If you often get disconnected from the server due to high ping, check the **KeepAliveTimeout** setting. This setting can cause the server connection to drop if there is a long timeout. We have a dedicated article on this, so feel free to check and adjust this setting. 🔒

#### 5. **Local ISP and Network:**
   - Sometimes, high ping issues are not from the server but from your local ISP. If many people are online on the same network, it can increase latency. Try using a **VPN** to see if the issue can be resolved. If it still doesn't change, contact your ISP. 🌐

### 💡 What to Do Next?
- **Check Your Network:** If high ping occurs on all servers, there might be an issue with your internet connection. Make sure you use a stable connection and if possible, use a **wired connection** (Ethernet) instead of WiFi to reduce interference. 📶

- **Use a VPN:** If the ping is still high after checking all the steps, try using a **VPN**. A VPN can route traffic through a faster path. 🔑

- **Contact Us:** If you've tried everything and still have issues, you can contact our support team. If you are a ZeroCloud user, we are ready to help with a support ticket. If not, contact your hosting provider to help check the issue on their side. 📩

High ping can really disrupt your gaming experience, but with the tips above, hopefully, you can game smoothly again. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions! 😎
