Want to make your Minecraft server even cooler? It's super easy! Check out the following plugin installation guide, guaranteed to be simple and hassle-free.

## Before Starting, Choose the Right Server Version

Make sure you're using a Minecraft server version that supports plugins. The safest and most recommended options are: [Paper](https://papermc.io/) or [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/download/purpur/).

Why choose Paper/Purpur? Because:

* Very stable

* Always updated

* Supports plugins from Bukkit, Spigot, etc.

If you're still using **Bukkit or Spigot**, try upgrading to Paper/Purpur.

> ⚠️ **Important note:** Modded servers like Forge or Fabric **cannot** run plugins. Hybrid servers that claim to support both are usually unstable. So it's better to choose one.

## How to Install Minecraft Plugins (Step-by-Step)

Ready? Let's get started! 💻

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a Safe Plugin 🔍">
    There are many sites to download plugins. Here are some recommended ones:

    * [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org)

    * [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org)

    * [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)

    Avoid shady sites offering pirated plugins. Besides being unethical, the risk of getting a virus is very high. 😬

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Plugin Compatibility ✅">
    Before downloading, check if the plugin supports your Minecraft server version. Usually, there's info in the **"Tested Minecraft Versions"** section. If the main version (e.g., 1.20) is supported, usually the minor versions (like 1.20.2) are also safe.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download Plugin 💾">
    Click the **"Download Now"** button and save the .jar plugin file to your computer.

  <Step title="Upload Plugin to Server 📤">
    1. Make sure your server is turned off (shutdown). This is important to keep all data safe.

    2. Open the **File Manager** in your server panel.

    3. Find the **"plugins"** folder. If it doesn't exist, try running the server once to create the folder.

    4. Drag and drop the .jar plugin file into the "plugins" folder in the server panel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Server 🔄">
    After uploading the file, turn your server back on. If everything goes well, type **"pl"** in the server console. The newly installed plugin will appear in the list.
  </Step>
</Steps>
